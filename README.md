# Review of Eugene's IN14 clock

## What I liked:

This is absolutely gorgeous looking product. Eugene's design is beautiful and the quality of wood, the attention to details and the style are all perfect. This was made with love and you can feel it.
I also love the internal battery that keeps the clock going (with display off) when it's unplugged. Nice to not have to set it up every time I plug it again.

## What I have mixed feelings about:

The time from order to delivery was two months. I am absolutely not mad about it. First, scraping old Soviet electronics for Nixie lamps is not an easy job, as they are no longer produced. Also Eugene messaged me about possibility to get it earlier if I switch to another wood type - nice to ask, and (as I wanted Bog Oak really badly) I felt quite fair when it got me another tiny delay.

One month of that was delay on the border. But there was only post to blame there. So no hard feelings.

## What I do not like:

Brightness settings. They don't seem to change anything - why to put them in then.

Not adding a power adapter, only a cable. It costs $160 dollars and is a kind of a premium product, so not spending $5 on USB power brick feels unreasonable.

Using 5.5/2.1mm power adapter jack as a plug. I feel like my parents at some point will lose the included cable and plug in common 12V adapter (instead of 5V USB voltage), probably frying the circut. I hope that won't happen. Changing the plug into microUSB or Type-C would prevent souch errors and make the cable easly replaceble.

Display. Yes, when it shows the steady image it's good (tho quite stroby for these sensitive to it). When the hour change the entire set of lamps flashes over possible configurations. That doesn't look nice. That totally doesn't fit the simplicity of the design and will probably make it an annoying bedside clock.
